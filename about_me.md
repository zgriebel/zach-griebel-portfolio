I am a graduate from Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota with a double major in Data Science and Physics. I am an analytical thinker who enjoys problem-solving. During college I also served as a [Captain of our football team](https://zgriebel.github.io/zach-griebel-portfolio/Honors-and-Awards/). This developed strengths within mindful communication, collaboration, and the ability to not take myself too seriously. I have been [working in software development and data analysis since 2021](https://zgriebel.github.io/zach-griebel-portfolio/Experience/) with published research. I am currently looking for an opportunity to contribute and grow in the field of machine learning and data science. 

Personal - I enjoy being outdoors, traveling, and am unfortunately a die hard Minnesota sports fan.
