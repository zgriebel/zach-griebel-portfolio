I am a graduate from Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota with a double major in Data Science and Physics. I have a strong programming background and enjoy storytelling telling with data to solve problems. I am an excellent communicator with a history of successful [leadership](https://zgriebel.github.io/Honors-and-Awards/). I have been [working in software development and data analysis since 2021](https://zgriebel.github.io/Experience/) and am excited to contribute and continue growing in Data Science and Data Analytics. 

Personal - I enjoy being outdoors, traveling, and am unfortunately a die hard Minnesota sports fan.
